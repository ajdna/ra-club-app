## 🆕 SESSION 4 (2026-06-27) — E2E coverage expansion + single blocker

**What was done:**
- Added 4 new E2E spec files: `admin.spec.ts`, `members.spec.ts`, `messaging.spec.ts`,
  `misc-features.spec.ts` (role-gated; auto-skip without `ADMIN_EMAIL`/`TEST_EMAIL`).
- Updated `.env.test.example` with `ADMIN_EMAIL`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD`/`TEST_*` role env vars.
- Ran full suite against Vercel prod: **31 pass / 9 fail**.

**The 9 failures share ONE root cause (not 9 bugs):**
`e2e-bot@rubyankur.test` is a Supabase **Auth** user with **no `users` row** →
`getCurrentUser()` returns `"unlinked"` (`src/lib/auth.ts`) → app shows the
"Almost there" screen → every member/messaging/misc test logging in as e2e-bot fails.

The existing `20260608100000_auth_auto_link.sql` trigger only links when a matching
`users` row already exists (by email/phone). e2e-bot has none, so re-firing it is a no-op.
**Fix = create a `users` row pointing at the auth user.**

**BLOCKER — user action required (auth/schema change, needs explicit confirmation):**
- **Option A (Dashboard):** Table Editor → `users` → Insert: `auth_id` = e2e-bot uuid,
  `email`, `role=member`, `status=active`, `name`.
- **Option B (script, added this session):** `scripts/link_test_account.sql` — edit the
  `v_email`/`v_role` CONFIG values, paste into Supabase SQL Editor, run. Idempotent, fails
  loudly if auth user missing, auto-attaches under existing `club_owner`, `ON CONFLICT`
  back-fills `auth_id`. After running → re-run E2E → expect **40/40 pass**.

**Why I can't do it:** linking requires Supabase admin creds + is an auth/schema action
→ paused per AGENTS.md destructive-action policy.

## SESSION 3 (2026-06-27) — Registration hardening

**Symptom:** new-user registration spinner froze ("Register ho raha hai…"), no success/error.

**Root causes (diagnosed via Supabase logs + live DB):**
1. Supabase Auth "Confirm email" was ON with a custom SMTP whose creds failed → `535` /
   "Error sending confirmation email". User turned confirmation **OFF** → signup now logs
   in immediately (`immediate_login_after_signup`). Correct fix: access is gated by
   club-owner approval, so email verification is redundant.
2. Phone `+919592839444` was already on a leftover inactive test row (`123@gmai.com`), so
   `register_user_v2` raised "Phone already registered".
3. `RegisterForm.submit()` had no try/catch/finally and ran `signOut()` before `setError`,
   so the real error never surfaced → frozen spinner.
4. Each failed attempt left an **orphaned auth user** (signup ok, profile insert failed).

**Fixes applied this session:**
| Fix | File / object | Status |
|-----|---------------|--------|
| New pre-check RPC `check_registration_available(email,username,phone)` (anon-callable) | `supabase/migrations/20260623000000_registration_precheck.sql` | ✅ Applied to live DB + migration file |
| Robust `submit()` — pre-check before signUp, try/catch/finally, errors always show, signOut non-blocking | `src/app/auth/register/RegisterForm.tsx` | ✅ Edited (needs commit) |
| `null` → `undefined` for optional RPC args (post `gen:types`) | `admin/actions.ts` (update_user_role, update_user_details), `admin/import/actions.ts` (bulk_upsert_user) | ✅ Edited (needs commit) |
| Freed stuck phone on leftover test row (non-destructive) | live DB row `a9782d36…` | ✅ Done |
| **Detached-RPC `this` bug** — `const rpc = supabase.rpc` loses `this` → runtime "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'rest')". Caught by live deploy test (build gate can't see it). Fixed with `.bind(supabase)` | `RegisterForm.tsx`, `login/page.tsx`, `auth/register/actions.ts` | ✅ Fixed + deployed (78e5255) + **live-tested PASS**: duplicate email → "Email already registered", no freeze, no crash |

**Still open for the user to decide:**
- 2 orphaned auth users (`raclubuser1@gmail.com`, `rubyankur30@gmail.com`) block re-using
  those exact emails. Delete them in Supabase → Authentication → Users, OR test with a
  fresh email. (Permanent delete → user action.)
- Commit + push the code changes: `npm run verify` then commit `RegisterForm.tsx`,
  `admin/actions.ts`, `admin/import/actions.ts`, the new migration, `AGENTS.md`,
  `KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md`, `.githooks/post-commit`.

**Infra added this session:** `post-commit` hook flags graph stale (`../graphify-out/.needs_update`);
AGENTS.md + KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md codify the read-graph-first / update-handoff-last protocol.

**Execution plan (2026-06-27):** `docs/PROJECT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` — per-feature pipeline (10 stages, model/agent per stage), version mgmt (per-feature branch + tag + Vercel rollback + reversible migrations + `rule_config` feature flags), go-live + sustainment routine, Cowork/Code/ZCode tool split + token discipline. Scope locked: Phase 1 = followup/health-score/identity/hierarchy + approval queue; food-logging deferred; treasury cut. Awaiting owner review before Phase 0.

**Cross-platform push notifications (2026-06-27):** decided web-push (WhatsApp-style), iPhone via installed PWA, build 5 triggers on existing infra.
- New `src/lib/notify.ts` — `notify()` writes in-app row + sends web push; `notifyApprovalRequest()`, `notifyNewDownlineMember()`.
- Migration `20260627000000_notification_types_push.sql` — enum adds: message_received, broadcast_received, approval_request, new_downline_member (applied to live DB).
- #3 Messages + #4 Broadcasts: already pushed by existing `push-notify` DB trigger on chat_messages (both create chat_messages). Left as-is to avoid double-notify.
- #5 Approval request → club owner: wired in `auth/register/actions.ts` (`notifyApprovalRequest`).
- #6 New downline member → direct upline: wired in `admin/actions.ts approveUser` (`notifyNewDownlineMember`).
- #7 Today's tasks: `api/cron/morning` now also web-pushes members (weight log) + coaches (follow-ups), not just in-app rows.
- TODO: re-run `npm run gen:types` so new enum values are typed (then drop the `as "info"` cast in notify.ts). iPhone needs Add-to-Home-Screen + notification permission inside installed PWA (PushPermission component). Native FCM/APNs = future phase for guaranteed background delivery in the Capacitor WebView.

**Approvals surfacing + Admin Console move (2026-06-27):**
- Home dashboard (owner): action banner "N naya registrations approval ke liye pending" → `/admin/users` (`src/app/(app)/page.tsx`). Chose non-intrusive action card + badge over a modal popup (current mobile best practice).
- AppBar account button: red count badge when approvals pending; **Admin Console** moved INTO the account dropdown (owner-only) with the same count badge (`AppBar.tsx`, fed `isOwner`/`pendingApprovals` from `(app)/layout.tsx`).
- Removed the Admin Console shortcut from the Profile page (`profile/page.tsx`).

**Graph refreshed (2026-06-27):** ran `graphify update .` (code-only, AST, **0 tokens**) →
now 4011 nodes / 4342 edges / 530 communities (was 1127/1799/108). Curated semantic graph
backed up in `../graphify-out/2026-06-27/`. NOTE: AST pass does not nodalize `.sql` RPCs
(`register_user_v2`, `check_registration_available`) or design/doc concepts — that needs the
LLM semantic `/graphify --update` (costs tokens, optional). In a Cowork sandbox the manifest
root changes each session so `update` full-rebuilds (still free); on the user's machine via
Claude Code it will be truly incremental.

**Semantic top-up (2026-06-27):** added the registration DB layer as first-class nodes and
reclustered → 4019 nodes / 4355 edges / 529 communities. New nodes (all connected, queryable
via `graphify explain`/`query`): `register_user_v2`, `check_registration_available`,
`get_login_email`, `users.username`, `users.whatsapp_phone`, `users` table, + the two
migration nodes — wired to `RegisterForm.tsx`, `registerUser()`, `LoginForm()`.

## ✅ EARLIER BLOCKER RESOLVED (session 2)

The Supabase Email provider was **disabled** in the dashboard. The user has since enabled it. All 17 e2e tests passed in session 2.

---

## 🧪 Current Test Status

**Latest run (session 4, vs Vercel prod): 31 pass / 9 fail — all 9 share one root cause**

| File | Tests | Result |
|------|-------|--------|
| `public.spec.ts` | 3 | ✅ All pass |
| `register.spec.ts` | 4 | ✅ All pass |
| `authed.spec.ts` | 4 | ✅ All pass |
| `features.spec.ts` | 6 | ✅ All pass |
| `admin.spec.ts` | 3 (new) | ✅ All pass |
| `members.spec.ts` | ~5 (new) | ❌ Fail — e2e-bot unlinked (see Session 4 blocker) |
| `messaging.spec.ts` | ~3 (new) | ❌ Fail — e2e-bot unlinked |
| `misc-features.spec.ts` | ~5 (new) | ❌ Fail — e2e-bot unlinked |

**Fix the single blocker (`scripts/link_test_account.sql`) → expect 40/40 pass.**

### Earlier flaky tests (fixed in session 2)
Two tests in `features.spec.ts` had intermittent navigation timeouts (Next.js client-side routing slower than 5s default):
- `account menu: Profile navigates to /profile` (line 34)
- `coach Plan tab opens follow-ups` (line 48)

**Fix applied:** Increased `toHaveURL` timeout from 5s → 10s on both assertions. File: `e2e/features.spec.ts`.

## 🔧 Fixes Applied (across both sessions)

| Fix | File | Change | Status |
|-----|------|--------|--------|
| Turbopack Windows workaround | `playwright.config.ts:42` | `npm run dev` → `npx next dev --webpack` | ✅ Committed (`004a56f`) |
| Flaky navigation timeout | `e2e/features.spec.ts:34,48` | Added `timeout: 10_000` to `toHaveURL` | ⚠️ Applied, not yet committed |
| e2e-bot test user | Supabase (user + users row) | Created by user in Dashboard | ✅ Done |

## 📋 Remaining Pipeline Steps

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| 1. E2E test run | ✅ 17/17 pass |
| 2. Fix errors | ✅ Flaky tests fixed |
| 3. Commit + push | ⚠️ Needs: `git add e2e/features.spec.ts && git commit && git push` |
| 4. Feature docs | ✅ This HANDOFF.md IS the feature doc |
| 5. Update README.md | 🔲 README is stale — still claims "scaffold, no features" |
| 6. Deploy to Vercel | 🔲 Needs user confirmation (outward-facing action) |

---

## 🛠️ How to Run Tests

**Windows / PowerShell:**
```powershell
cd "D:\RA Club\CLUB APP\club-app"
npx playwright test --reporter=list
```
(Playwright auto-starts dev server via `npx next dev --webpack` from config.)

---

## ⚠️ Destructive/irreversible actions policy
Per AGENTS.md: deploy, delete, payment, and auth/schema changes always pause for explicit user confirmation.
